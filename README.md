###  Abstract
Cardiac segmentation from echocardiography is crucial for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases and assessing cardiac function. In this study, we propose a hybrid deep learning ensemble model for automatic segmentation of cardiac structures from 2-chamber echocardiography views. Our framework integrates multiple U-Net architectures with advanced meta-learning techniques to combine their predictive strengths. Experimental evaluations on benchmark cardiac datasets demonstrate that the proposed ensemble achieves superior segmentation performance with high Dice coefficients across all cardiac structures. These results highlight the potential of hybrid ensemble methods as reliable computer-aided diagnostic tools for cardiology, contributing to accurate and efficient cardiac analysis.

### Model Architectures
**Advanced U-Net Model**
A sophisticated U-Net architecture with increased capacity featuring:
- Enhanced encoder-decoder structure with residual connections
- Batch normalization and dropout for regularization
- 64-1024 filter progression with skip connections
- Advanced data augmentation pipeline

**Deep U-Net Improved**
A deeper U-Net variant with:
- Expanded network depth for complex feature learning
- Dense convolutional blocks with he_normal initialization
- Multi-scale feature extraction capabilities
- Optimized gradient flow

**Meta-Learner Ensemble**
The predictions from individual U-Net models are combined using:
- Feature extraction from model predictions (probabilities, entropy, confidence)
- Random Forest and Gradient Boosting meta-learners
- Optimal combination learning for final segmentation
